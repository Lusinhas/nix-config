# Nix Config

Just a NixOS config I made for personal usage.

# Features

- Desktop Environment: KDE Plasma
- Secret Manager: Agenix
- User Environment Manager: Home Manager

# Usage

- Bootable ISO generation: `nix build .#iso`
- Installation: boot into the generated ISO and run `sudo install-os`, then follow what it says to continue.
